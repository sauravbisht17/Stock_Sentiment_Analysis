## Introduction

The Stock Sentiment Analysis notebook is designed to perform sentiment analysis on stock-related text data, such as news articles, social media posts, and financial reports. The goal is to classify the sentiment of the text as either positive or negative, which can be useful for traders, investors, and financial analysts.

## Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (specified in the notebook)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloud, nltk, gensim, tensorflow, transformers).
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`Stock_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb`).
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the models, and perform inference.

## Notebook Structure

The Jupyter Notebook covers the following tasks:

1. **Understanding the Problem Statement and Business Case**
2. **Importing Libraries and Datasets, and Exploratory Data Analysis**
3. **Data Cleaning**
4. **Visualization**
5. **Text Preprocessing**
6. **Building and Training Custom Deep Neural Networks**
7. **Evaluating Model Performance**
8. **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**
9. **Inference on New Data**
